# Exercise 1: Migrate a Linux VM to an Azure VM

Contoso Inc. is in the early stages of its infrastructure modernization journey, aiming to reduce datacenter overhead and improve operational agility by migrating key workloads to Azure. Among its legacy systems is a Linux-based personnel management application running on a Hyper-V virtual machine. While the application remains critical to daily operations, its underlying infrastructure is aging and difficult to scale. To preserve compatibility while gaining cloud-based resilience and manageability, Contoso has chosen a lift-and-shift migration strategy for this workload.

In this exercise, you will use the [Azure Migrate Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/prepare-for-migration?view=migrate-classic) to assess, replicate, and migrate a Hyper-Vâ€“based Ubuntu VM to Azure. This process simulates the real-world steps Contoso's IT team would follow to transition legacy infrastructure into a cloud-first model.

## Objectives

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:

- Assess the readiness of a Linux VM for migration to Azure
- Configure replication of the VM using Azure Migrate
- Perform a lift-and-shift migration of the VM to Azure

## Duration

**Estimated time**: 1 Hour and 15 minutes

# Task 1: Test the application before migration

## Introduction

Before initiating a migration, it is critical to confirm that the source Linux VM is functioning properly in the Hyper-V environment. This includes verifying that the personnel management application is running and successfully connecting to the SQL Server database.

## Description

In this task, you will log in to the `LinuxLabVM-Ubuntu` virtual machine and test the personnel management application to ensure it is operational prior to migration.

## Success criteria

- You can connect to the Linux VM in Hyper-V Manager.
- You can run the server application from Visual Studio Code.
- You can confirm that data is returned successfully in the web app accessing the SQL database.

# Task 4: Register an Azure Migrate appliance

## Introduction

To begin discovery and assessment of on-premises virtual machines, Azure Migrate requires an appliance to be registered and connected to your Azure Migrate project. The appliance collects metadata about your Hyper-V environment and securely transmits it to Azure for analysis. You will use the Azure Migrate Appliance Configuration Manager to register your appliance with the Azure Migrate project created earlier. This step enables discovery of virtual machines hosted on your Hyper-V environment.

## Description

In this task, you will register the pre-provisioned Azure Migrate appliance using the Appliance Configuration Manager.

# Task 5: Discover virtual machines and workloads on the Hyper-V host

## Introduction

Once the Azure Migrate appliance has been registered, you can begin the discovery process for virtual machines hosted on your Hyper-V environment. The discovery process collects metadata about VM configurations, operating systems, and resource usage, which helps assess readiness and plan migration strategies.

By enabling guest discovery, you can also identify workloads running inside the virtual machinesâ€”such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and other database platforms. This deeper insight allows you to plan workload-specific migrations and apply appropriate tooling and remediation steps. Guest discovery requires valid credentials and access to the VMs to collect software inventory, dependencies, and workload metadata.

## Description

In this task, you configure discovery credentials and host details in the Azure Migrate Appliance Configuration Manager, then initiate the discovery process. With guest discovery enabled, the appliance will identify both virtual machines and the workloads running inside them, including database platforms and installed software. Discovery results are sent to your Azure Migrate project for review.

## Success criteria

- You started a discovery in the Azure Migrate project  
- You identified virtual machines and their associated workloads using guest discovery  
- You reviewed the discovery results in the Azure portal

# Task 6: Perform Assessments of discovered resources

## Introduction

With discovery complete, Contoso's migration team is ready to assess the readiness of key workloads for migration to Azure. This includes the Linux-based personnel system running on `LinuxLabVM-Ubuntu`, as well as SQL Server and PostgreSQL database instances discovered through guest-level inspection.

Azure Migrate assessments help estimate sizing, identify compatibility issues, and surface remediation guidance. By assessing both infrastructure and workload-level details, Contoso can make informed decisions about migration tooling, target platforms, and performance expectations.

## Description

In this task, you create assessments for the Linux VM, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL workloads discovered by the Azure Migrate appliance. These assessments will help validate sizing, compatibility, and migration readiness for each resource.

# Task 7: Replicate the Linux Ubuntu VM to Azure

## Introduction

With the assessment complete, Contoso's migration team is ready to replicate the Linux-based personnel system to Azure. This task simulates the final stages of a lift-and-shift migration using Azure Migrate. You'll configure replication using the Azure Site Recovery provider and registration key.

## Description

In this task, you will download the Azure Site Recovery provider and registration key, install the provider on the Hyper-V host, and configure replication for the `LinuxLabVM-Ubuntu` VM.

## Success criteria

- You downloaded and installed the Azure Site Recovery provider on the Hyper-V host
- You configured replication for the `LinuxLabVM-Ubuntu` VM
- You completed the replication process successfully

    > **NOTE**: You may see an error that the Azure Migrate service cannot access the replication storage account. This error is because the storage account does not have the proper access privilege to the Recovery Service vault. To resolve this issue, first open the Recovery Service Vault resource in another browser page and under `Settings | Identity` turn ON the status on the `System assigned` and select **Save**.
    >
    > ![Screenshot of the steps to turn on the System Assigned identity for the recovery services vault.](./media/51-IAM-RecoveryVault.png)
