# Exercise 7: Migrate on-premises PostgreSQL database to Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

Contoso Inc. is modernizing its infrastructure to improve scalability, security, and operational efficiency. As part of this initiative, the company plans to migrate its legacy DVD rental application to Azure. This application relies on a PostgreSQL database named `dvdrental`, which currently resides on an on-premises Linux VM. To ensure a smooth transition, Contoso will use the built-in migration service in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server to move the database to a managed Azure environment.

In this exercise, you will use the [migration service in Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/migrate/migration-service/overview-migration-service-postgresql) to validate the source database and perform a full migration to Azure. This approach allows Contoso to benefit from Azure's built-in high availability, automated backups, and performance tuning features while minimizing downtime and manual effort.

> **Note**: Additional context about online migration and real-world networking
>
> For simplicity, this lab focuses on an offline migration scenario. However, the migration service for Azure Database for PostgreSQL also supports online migrations, which allow continuous data replication from the source to Azure with minimal downtime. This is especially useful for production environments where cutover windows must be tightly controlled. Read the [online migration setup documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/migrate/migration-service/tutorial-migration-service-iaas-online?tabs=portal) to learn more.
>
> In real-world deployments, network architecture is often more complex than the lab setup. On-premises environments typically connect to Azure through VPN gateways, ExpressRoute, or private endpoints within Azure Virtual Networks (VNets). These configurations ensure secure, low-latency connectivity between source and target environments. You may also need to configure VNet peering, NSG rules, and firewall exceptions to allow replication traffic. For guidance on networking best practices, refer to the [how to set up the network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/migrate/migration-service/how-to-network-setup-migration-service) documentation for the migration service.

## Objectives

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:

- Evaluate the compatibility of an on-premises PostgreSQL database for migration to Azure using built-in validation tools.
- Perform a full offline migration of a PostgreSQL database to Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server using the integrated migration service.
- Verify the integrity of the migrated schema and data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

## Duration

**Estimated time**: 25 minutes

# Task 1: Review Azure Migrate PostgreSQL assessment

## Introduction

Before migrating a PostgreSQL database to Azure, it is essential to assess its compatibility with the target environment. In Exercise 1, you conducted an assessment of the PostgreSQL server hosting the `dvdrental` database using Azure Migrate. This assessment can help to identify unsupported features, extensions, or configurations that may require remediation before proceeding with the migration.

## Description

In this task, you will review the assessment report generated by Azure Migrate to understand any potential blockers or considerations for migrating the `dvdrental` database to Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server.

## Success criteria

- The assessment report for the `dvdrental` database has been reviewed.
- Any identified issues or blockers have been documented for further action before migration.
- The assessment confirms that the database is compatible with Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, or necessary remediation steps have been identified.
- The source PostgreSQL server has been verified to run version 9.5 or higher, ensuring compatibility with the migration service in Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

# Task 2: Ensure connectivity between source and target PostgreSQL servers

## Introduction

Before a migration can begin, the source PostgreSQL server must be reachable by the target Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. Connectivity to the source database in typically controlled by the PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration file (`pg_hba.conf`), which defines which hosts are allowed to connect, which users and databases they can access, and what authentication methods are permitted. Ensuring that the target server is authorized in this file is a critical prerequisite for a successful migration.

## Description

In this task, you will connect to the on-premises PostgreSQL server hosted on the `LinuxLabVM-CentOS-7-PostGreSQL` virtual machine and verify connectivity between the source and target PostgreSQL servers. You will inspect the `pg_hba.conf` file on the source server to verify that it allows connections from external hosts, including the Azure target server.

## Success criteria

- Network connectivity between the source and target servers has been confirmed, allowing secure and reliable data transfer.

## Learning resources

- [Prerequisites for migrating from an on-premises PostgreSQL server to Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/migrate/migration-service/tutorial-migration-service-iaas-offline?tabs=portal#prerequisites)

## Key tasks

1. [] Locate the IP address of the `LinuxLabVM-CentOS-7-PostGreSQL` VM by opening the `VM_IPs.txt` file on the Lab VM's desktop.

    ![The Lab VM's desktop is displayed with the VM_IPs text file highlight and its contents displayed in the open file.](./media/lab-vm-desktop-vm-ips.png)

2. [] From the `VM_IPs.txt` file, copy the **private IP** address of the `LinuxLabVM-CentOS-7-PostGreSQL` VM.

    ![The contents of the VM_IPs.txt file are displayed, with the private IP address of the LinuxLabVM-CentOS-7-PostGreSQL VM highlighted with a red box.](./media/vm-ips-txt-postgresql-private.png)

3. [] Open **PuTTY** from the Lab VM's desktop or Start menu. Paste the private IP address into the **Host Name (or IP address)** field in the PuTTY Configuration dialog, then select **Open**.

    ![The PuTTY Configuration dialog is displayed, with the private IP address of the LinuxLabVM-CentOS-7-PostGreSQL VM highlighted in the Host Name (or IP address) box and the Open button highlighted.](./media/lab-vm-putty-postgres-private-ip.png)

4. [] In the PuTTY console, log in using the following credentials:

   - [] **Login**: root
   - [] **Password**: Pa$$w0rd

5. [] Verify that the `psql` client is installed by running the following command:

    ```bash
    psql --version
    ```

6. [] Connect to the `dvdrental` database using the `psql` client:

    > **IMPORTANT**  
    > Replace `<PRIVATE_IP_OF_YOUR_POSTGRESQL_SERVER>` with the private IP address you copied earlier.

    ```bash
    psql -h <PRIVATE_IP_OF_YOUR_POSTGRESQL_SERVER> -U pgadmin -d dvdrental
    ```

7. [] When prompted, enter the password for the **pgadmin** user: `pgadmin123`.

8. [] At the database prompt in the PuTTY terminal, run the following command to locate the active `pg_hba.conf` file:

    ```sql
    SHOW hba_file;
    ```

9. [] Copy the file path from the output, which should be `/var/lib/pgsql/14/data/pg_hba.conf`.

10. [] Disconnect from the `dvdrental` database to return to the shell prompt:

    ```sql
    \q
    ```

11. [] At the PuTTY command prompt, run the following command to view the contents of the `pg_hba.conf` file. Replace `<YOUR_HBA_FILE_LOCATION>` with the path you copied above:

    ```bash
    cat <YOUR_HBA_FILE_LOCATION>
    ```

    The output should include `host` records that allow connections from external IP ranges. For example:

    ```bash
    # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
    host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5
    ```

    This entry allows any host to connect using MD5 password authentication. For production environments, this rule should be scoped to specific IP ranges for security, but for this lab, it ensures that the migration service in Azure Database for PostgreSQL can reach the source server.

# Task 3: Prepare the target Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server

## Introduction

To ensure compatibility between the source and target environments, the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server must be configured to match the source server's extensions and server parameters. Extensions and parameters are not automatically migrated, so they must be reviewed and manually enabled before starting the migration.

Extensions in PostgreSQL are modular packages that add functionality such as new data types, functions, or indexing methods. Server parameters are configuration settings that control database behavior, performance, and resource usage.

## Description

In this task, you will identify the extensions used by the source database and enable them on the target Azure server.

## Success criteria

- All required extensions have been identified and successfully enabled on the target Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

## Learning resources

- [Prerequisites for migrating from an on-premises PostgreSQL server to Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/migrate/migration-service/tutorial-migration-service-iaas-offline?tabs=portal#prerequisites)

## Key tasks

1. [] Reconnect to the `dvdrental` database in the PuTTY terminal by running the following command. Replace `<PRIVATE_IP_OF_YOUR_POSTGRESQL_SERVER>` with the private IP address of the source VM:

    ```bash
    psql -h <PRIVATE_IP_OF_YOUR_POSTGRESQL_SERVER> -U pgadmin -d dvdrental
    ```

2. [] When prompted, enter the password for the **pgadmin** user: `pgadmin123`

3. [] At the `dvdrental` prompt, run the following `psql` meta-command to list installed extensions:

    ```bash
    \dx
    ```

    The output should show the `plpgsql` extension, which is required for procedural logic in PostgreSQL:

    ```bash
                     List of installed extensions
      Name   | Version |   Schema   |         Description
    ---------+---------+------------+------------------------------
     plpgsql | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
    ```

    > Alternatively, you can get the list of installed extensions using the following SQL command:
    >
    > ```sql
    > SELECT extname, extversion FROM pg_extension;
    > ```

4. [] Disconnect from the `dvdrental` database to return to the shell prompt:

    ```sql
    \q
    ```

5. [] Leave the PuTTY terminal by running for use later in this exercise.

# Task 4: Migrate the database

## Introduction

Once the source database has been assessed and any necessary preparations have been made, you can proceed with the migration. You can initiate the migration using the Azure Database for PostgreSQL migration service. This process transfers the schema and data from the source to the target server, preserving object definitions, relationships, and data integrity. The migration is performed in offline mode, meaning the source database is not actively serving traffic during the transfer.

## Description

In this task, you will configure and launch the migration and monitor its progress.

## Success criteria

- A migration job has been configured and launched using the Azure portal.
- The `dvdrental` database has been selected and migrated without errors.
- The migration status in the Azure portal shows Succeeded, indicating a complete and successful transfer.
